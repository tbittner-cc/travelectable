## ChatGPT tells me this is our color scheme ##
Certainly! Here are some colors that accompany blue well, along with suggestions on where to use them on your travel site:

1. **Blue (#0074D9)**: Use this as the primary color for your site's header, navigation menu, and prominent call-to-action buttons. Blue conveys trust, reliability, and a sense of calm, making it ideal for establishing a positive first impression.

2. **White (#FFFFFF)**: Utilize white as the background color for your site to create a clean and spacious layout. It helps content stand out and ensures readability.

3. **Light Gray (#CCCCCC)**: Use light gray for secondary elements such as borders, dividers, and background accents. It adds depth to your design without overwhelming the blue and white color scheme.

4. **Teal (#39CCCC)**: Teal can be used sparingly to add visual interest and contrast to specific sections or elements, such as hover effects, icons, or selected buttons.

5. **Navy Blue (#001f3f)**: Incorporate navy blue for text elements, such as headlines, paragraphs, and links. It provides a darker shade of blue that still complements the primary blue hue while enhancing readability.

6. **Sky Blue (#87CEEB)**: Use sky blue for background accents or highlights, particularly in sections where you want to evoke a sense of openness or freedom, such as images of clear skies or open landscapes.

7. **Gold (#FFD700)**: Add touches of gold for special elements like badges, awards, or premium offerings. Gold contrasts beautifully with blue and adds a touch of luxury or exclusivity to your site.

8. **Slate Gray (#2c3e50)**: Consider using slate gray for footer sections or other areas where you want to maintain a professional and grounded appearance. It provides a subtle contrast to the primary blue color while maintaining a cohesive look.

By incorporating these colors strategically throughout your website, you can create a visually appealing and cohesive design that reflects the trustworthiness, reliability, and serenity associated with blue, while also enhancing readability and user experience.
